Here are some of my past and current projects. (non exhaustive!)

# Current
- **[Rishe](https://rishe.ca):** Co-founder. Semantic search over local items. Support local, shop smart.

- **[Bookmi](https://bookmiapp.com):** Also co-founder. Book local services as seamlessly as ordering on uber eats.

- **Matchups:** Making a website to visualize character matchups in fighting games, as well as calculating optimal roster combinations for matchup coverage. (kinda gave up on it, we'll see where it goes)

- **GENPC:** RAG NPC creator and dialogue generation webapp with dynamic conversation triggers based on sentiment metrics. (not deployed, also somewhat abandoned)

# Past projects
- **Planet Generator:** My first ever coding project. Customizable procedural planet generation in Unity with editor scrips and noise maps. Might come back to it to make a full plugin with new features, such as simulated water erosion, and gpu-based generation.

- **Fake News Corrector:** (deprecated) Project for McGill's MAIS 202 AI bootcamp. Experimental ML-based fake news detection and correciton using text-based neural networks, sentiment analysis and topic modelling. Ran as a standalone app or chrome extension. Returns a confidence score based on the tone and language used on a webpage. Returns list of alternative articles from trusted news sources with similar topics queried from News API for low confidence scores.
