    Link to heading
  


Planet Generator: My first ever coding project. Customizable procedural planet generation in Unity with editor scrips and noise maps. Might come back to it to make a full plugin with new features, such as simulated water erosion, and gpu-based generation.
Fake News Corrector: [deprecated] Project for McGill&rsquo;s MAIS 202 AI bootcamp. Experimental ML-based fake news detection and correciton using text-based neural networks, sentiment analysis and topic modelling. Ran as a standalone app or chrome extension. Returns a confidence score based on the tone and language used on a webpage. Returns list of alternative articles from trusted news sources with similar topics queried from News API for low confidence scores.
